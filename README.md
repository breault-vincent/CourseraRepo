# Getting and Cleaning Data
Coursera assignement.

## Operations
This script takes data from wearable computing research, formats it to keep averages and standard deviations, and outputs a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject in the dataset. For more information refer to the codebook.md.

## Output
The script outputs a tidy_dataset.txt from a data frame of computed averages. It can be read using R's read.table function.
